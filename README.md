# Dotfiles
This is for a super-minimul Linux install, for old computers or new, but not so
minimul that you can't do everyday gooey jobs if you want to.

Install Arch from Axyl USB, select the **No Window Manager** option.

Once it's installed, git clone this repo (do you need to set up ssh?), then run
the *install.sh* script.

# Commands
This config is made so you can run your machine mainly in TTY then opens DWM
whenever you need a graphical environment. There's a few commands you can use
for this:

```
$ bravex
```

For Brave Browser, there's also `termx` for xfce4-terminal in DWM. Once these
programs open you're in DWM and can open more things but the session terminate
as soon as you quit the main program (Brave or xfce4).
